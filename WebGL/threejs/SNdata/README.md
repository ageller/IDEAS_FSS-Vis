## Plotted in galactocentric cartesian coordinates

Challenge #1:

1. Add more colormap options to the gui.
2. Color the points instead by the luminosity (using the log10lum key).

Challenge #2:

1. Add a new item to gui that controls the time.
2. Only show supernovae with that formed at a time less than the gui time.
