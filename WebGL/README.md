# WebGL 

WebGL is the browser equivalent of OpenGL; it's a way to access your computer graphics card to create graphics in real time in your browser.  WebGL code is written in javascript.  The library [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a very powerful resource for creating WebGL scenes.  If you are interested in OpenGL/WebGL graphics, I would recommend starting in WebGL with three.js.
