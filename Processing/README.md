Let's work in python mode.  See [here to get started](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/).  

This demo will use the video library and follow from [this java example](https://processing.org/tutorials/video/) and [this python example](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/blob/069dee655fa4083fb256f20da253fbdbc5dec5c2/mode/examples/Contributed%20Libraries%20in%20Python/OpenCV/LiveCamTest/LiveCamTest.pyde).  

First, you will need to install the video library (which doesn't come installed by default).  To do this, go to the menu "Sketch / Import Library ... / Add Library ...".  Import the "Video" library (from "The Processing Foundation").  You will also need to install the "OpenCV for Processing" library in the same way.
