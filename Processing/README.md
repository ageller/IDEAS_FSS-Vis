# Processing : https://processing.org/

Processing is a super fun tool that can run using a few different languages (including Python, and javascript).  It can be used locally, and can also be used on the web. 

Every Processing code as at least two function:

1. setup() : sets the scene (e.g., the size of the window, etc.).
2. draw() : the main draw loop that is executed every frame refresh time.

There are great [tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/) and [examples](https://processing.org/examples/) on the Processing website.
