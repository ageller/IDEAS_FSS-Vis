# A simple example of plotting data with Processing

I downloaded data from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) "Composite Planetary Data" table on Aug. 21, 2019.

This example 

* demonstrates how to read in a csv file
* plots ellipses for the orbits of exoplanets
* demonstrates how to use a 2-color colormap
* demostrates the use of mouseWheel
