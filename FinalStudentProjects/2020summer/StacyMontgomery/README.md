For my project, I have chosen to focus on the history of redlining and how it continues to influence us today. I study air quality, particularly the patterns of air quality within cities, so I am intrigued by geospatial connection between the environment and the people who live there. As a result, I took my expertise in spatial analysis and chemistry in order to explore the connection between these two geolocated datasets.

The software I chose to accomplish this task was D3 and html. The interactive maps in D3 allow for the user to scroll over areas and get the geolocated meta-data associated with the map. I find this helpful, because not only are there spatial patterns in the air quality plumes, but these places have grades from the redlining and various temporal dimensions that can be quickly summarized in a hover table. Using a website allows for me to update the information whenever I want. Even though the redline maps will not change anytime soon, it would be helpful to update the air quality data and look at even more information through the bones set up in this website. 

In order develop this tool, I processed the data in Python and coded the website using HTML, CSS, D3, and JavaScript. This was challenging-- while I am comfortable in Python, I had just learned the latter four languages. There was an additional challenge in the Python processing â€“ the datasets I used are huge and required a lot of analysis in order to find relevant meaning for the narrative I had constructed. 

The final product is relatively straightforward to use, in that it is set up like an interactive paper. The figures have tables that pop up when you scroll over them, and the demographic map has a drop-down menu to pick the three demographic areas of analysis. In conclusion of this analysis, I show that we still have redlining-like segregation within the US, though the air quality story is not as straightforward. The analysis could benefit from additional air quality datasets.
