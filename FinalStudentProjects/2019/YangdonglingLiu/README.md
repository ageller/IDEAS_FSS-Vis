My research is mainly on the fundamental surface chemistry of atmospheric aerosols, but Iâ€™m also interested in complicated field samples that require a lot of data analysis to unravel the underlying physics. In 2014, a student in my group participated in the GoAmazon Field Campaign, in which she went to the Amazon rainforests with other scientists and collected aerosol samples. From vibrational spectral analysis, we found that some samples show a distinctive peak in a certain region that might be associated with a certain structural motif. Our hypothesis was that it might be related to sulfate groups being attached to the molecule. So, we gathered data on the concentrations of all kinds of gas molecules during that period of time at the same location (T3). I am hoping to see if there is correlation between the concentration of one or more of the gases and the amplitude of that distinctive peak. And, in general, it would be helpful to visualize the correlations, if any, between any of those gases.

I first tried using Plotly to quickly see the correlation matrix of some clean data that I had. Then I found Bokeh to be a very useful library for interactive data visualization. One of the samples in the Bokeh Gallery (demo: https://demo.bokeh.org/stocks; code: https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples/app/stocks) has the template that well fits how I would like to visualize my data. In addition, Bokeh is based on Python, which I am more familiar with. By using Bokeh, I have been able to focus on learning various functions in the library and understanding the logic of building the interactivity, instead of getting used to the syntax of a brand new language.

Overall, the coding process has been smooth and fun, with small challenges in almost every step. First, I implemented the template with some readily available clean data by following and understanding every line in the sample. Then, I played around and got familiar with the tools and styling functions, and added a line of text that updates with the time frame on selection. After that, I cleaned up all the data we collected and added them to the project. I also tried to add two histograms for the x and y axes of the correlation plot, but wasn't able to make it work in time. This will be my homework.

The interface is very self-explanatory for users. On the widgets at the top-left corner, one can select two gases in the dropdown menu. The change of concentrations of the two selected gases will show up at the bottom, and the correlation plot will show up at the top-right corner. One can zoom in and out, and highlight a certain region of data by selecting them on the figures. The table summarizes the mean and standard deviation of the concentration in the selected time frame.

Because the data have not been published, in the notebook on the GitHub, I generated fake periodic time series data to demonstrate the template. When running the code for the first time, install the most recent version of timesynth module with the following command:
```
%%capture
!pip uninstall timesynth --yes
!pip install git+https://github.com/TimeSynth/TimeSynth.git
```

A Bokeh server is needed for full interactivity. In the terminal, navigate to the directory and then run:
```
bokeh serve project_Bokeh_fakedata.ipynb
```
Now, navigate to the following URL in a browser:
```
http://localhost:5006/project_Bokeh_fakedata
```
