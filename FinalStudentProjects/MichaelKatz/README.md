## A Gravitational Universe from Illustris Black Hole Mergers

The visualization  initially shows a zoom of the first two Massive Black Holes (MBHs) to merge in the Illustris cosmological simulation at a universal age of around 1 billion years. After the merger takes place, I zoom out to the entire Illustris box and illustrate the MBH binary evolution with gravitational waves. When MBHs merge, a dot is added with a color representing the strength of its gravitational wave signal as it is created. This color is also used in the gravitational wave leaving that binary. As the video evolves, it tells the viewer the size of the box, how many mergers have taken place, the age of the universe, and the redshift. The size of the box is important because it represents the expansion of the universe and how these black holes spread out over time. As these mergers take place, a Seaborn KDE contour plot is updated by showing a scatter dot for each new binary. This allows me to see the evolution of the parameter space observed in these mergers.
