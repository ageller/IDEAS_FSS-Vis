      Protoplanetary disks are the sites of active planet formation. 
      Using high-resolution/sensitivity observations of these disks, we are able to better understand the initial physical and chemical 
      conditions in which planets form. By obtaining statistics on a large sample of disks we are able to begin to link the current 
      exoplanet demographics to their natal environments. In the last decade there has been a huge advance in the study of protoplanetary 
      disks. With the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) telescope coming online, highly detailed maps of these disks have been produced. With 
      these exquisite maps, we have been able to measure their physical quantities, such as surface brightness and size. ALMA is able to 
      perform snapshot surveys of entire molecular clouds, the home to these disks, in less than an hour (depending on the sensitivity of 
      the observations). We now have data on numerous protoplanetary disks in multiple molecular clouds. This visualization attempts to 
      organize ~900 of these disks, spanning 7 molecular clouds to start to understand any trends seen in the data.
