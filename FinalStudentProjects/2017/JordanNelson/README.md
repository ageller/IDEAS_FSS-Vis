# Jordan Nelson's Final Project

## Electronics on the molecular scale

The visualization is summarized in a Jupyter notebook and has three components: 

(1) A movie of the vector representation of the magnetic moment I measure in my experiments (refocusing into an ‘echo’), composed with ffmpeg.  

(2) A surface plot of a simulation of the experiment (from an analytical expression in the literature) using matplotlib.

(3) 2-D Bokeh plots of a simplified simulation of the data with interactive widgets.
