Bokeh is a python package for creating interactive figures, which can also export to html format for use in websites.  Bokeh plots are supported by the American Astronomical Society (AAS) journals for publication of interactive figures.

The submodule on this page links to Aaron Geller's ["LCBokeh" GitHub repo](https://github.com/ageller/LCBokeh).  You can also view the notebook from the repo [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageller/LCBokeh/blob/master/LC_Bokeh.ipynb).
