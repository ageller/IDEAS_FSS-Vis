# Unity : https://unity.com/

Unity is a (free) game development engine that is also really great for interactive visualizations.  There's a bit of a steep learning curve (and the coding is in C#), but there are tons of walkthrough YouTube videos that will help get you started.  

I have linked here a few submodules of Unity projects I've worked on.  These links only include the script files needed, and will require extra setup to actually get them working on your end.  (I haven't figured out the best way to store these Unity projects on GitHub.)
