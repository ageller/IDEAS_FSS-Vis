# Adobe Illustrator : https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html

Illustrator is generally used for creating and editing vector graphics, e.g., logos and other scalable graphics that don't require mostly lines, gradients and polygons. This is a paid product ([though you can get it through Northwestern](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/software/adobe/)).
