The data here come from Pascal Paschos, formerly with NUIT. 

Note: For me, on Mac OS X 10.15.5 with a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016), Paraview version 5.8 (the most recent at this time) crashes when using Programmable Filter.  Version 5.7 will not open because of Mac's security.  I recommend using version 5.6.2.
