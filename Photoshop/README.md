# Adobe Photoshop : https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html

Photoshop is generally used to create and edit raster (pixel) images, e.g., an artistic interpretation of a science that requires detailed brush work. This is a paid product ([though you can get it through Northwestern](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/software/adobe/)).
