These data sets can be used to test and develop your visualizations, if you don't have your own data set to work with.  You can also find some of them within the different directories of this course, where they were downloaded or created.  In general, here's what they contain and where they come from:

* JPLNEOCloseApproaches_merge.csv : contains near Earth asteroids (NEOs) from the NASA JPL archive.  More information on this file can be found in [my GlueNEO repo](https://github.com/ageller/GlueNEO).  

* OpenSNCat.csv : contains supernovae data from the Open SNe Catalog.  More information can be found in this repo [here](https://github.com/ageller/IDEAS_FSS-Vis/tree/master/WebGL/threejs/SNdata).

* Petersburg Station Weather Data.csv : contains weather data.  This data set came from Frank Elavsky; I am not quite sure where he found it.

* compositepars_2019.08.21_11.02.05.csv : contains exoplanet data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.  Slightly more information can be found in this repo [here](https://github.com/ageller/IDEAS_FSS-Vis/tree/master/Processing/exoplanetExample).

* congress_data.csv : contains 2-dimensional data representing the politics of the US congress over the years, taken from https://voteview.com/data .  This data set is used in our matplotlib examples and also the D3 examples.

* tripcoll.csv : contains a 5-body gravitational scattering simulation, created using the code [FEWBODY](http://www.ascl.net/1208.011) and reformatted for ease of use.  

* WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv : COVID-19 data from the WHO.  The direct download link is [here](https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv), and those data are updated regularly.  There are also other interesting data sets on the WHO COVID page [here](https://covid19.who.int/data).
